                I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington in 2024 and am now a postdoc at Princeton University, working at the intersection of deep learning, computational neuroscience, and applied mathematics. I was named a

                My research leverages deep learning theory and recent neural recordings to explore how the brain learns to process information. This work has been supported by fellowships such as the NSERC PGS-D, FRQNT B2X, Pearson, and NSF AccelNet IN-BIC. I have published as the lead author in NeurIPS, ICLR, PNAS, and IEEE, focusing on biologically plausible learning models and their generalization properties. In addition to my theory-driven work, I use data-driven approaches to uncover learning strategies from animal data. I have also held visiting research roles at the Allen Institute, Mila, and MIT, and have taught and mentored extensively, earning a
